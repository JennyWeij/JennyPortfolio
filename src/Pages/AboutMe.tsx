              When asked whether this girl from Dalarna can handle stress,
              different types of people, other people's stress, structure, plan
              and carry out tasks, the answer is a clear YES. <br />
              My varied work experiences, particularly in the service industry,
              have equipped me with many adaptable skills.
              <br /> I am passionate about technology and its potential to drive
              positive change. I always strive to become better and to do a good
              job. I look forward to gaining a lot of trust and living up to the
              expectations set for me. <br />
              <br />
              When I am not coding I love to watch movies (all genres), listen
              to music (most genres but top 3 is: 80's, 90's and film scores),
              hang out with friends and family (both in Gothenburg and Borl√§nge)
              and eat amazing food at great restaurants (the spicier the
              better).
